You are given an array of non-negative integers height which represent an elevation map. Each value height[i] represents the height of a bar, which has a width of 1.

Return the maximum area of water that can be trapped between the bars.

Example 1:



Input: height = [0,2,0,3,1,0,1,3,2,1]

Output: 9
Constraints:

1 <= height.length <= 1000
0 <= height[i] <= 1000
